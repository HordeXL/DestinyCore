## 📖 Introduction

**DestinyCore** is a modern, modular **MMORPG server framework** written in C++ that supports **multiple platforms** (Windows, Linux, macOS) and builds cleanly with **GCC, Clang, and MSVC**.  

It is designed to be **lightweight, scalable, and extensible**, providing developers and server administrators with a stable foundation for World of Warcraft® (Legion 7.3.5) and beyond.  

Key goals of DestinyCore:
- ⚡ Modern C++ design (C++20+)
- 🔌 Modular architecture (authserver, worldserver, shared libs)
- 🤖 Integrated **PlayerBots** system
- 🌍 Multi-database support (auth, characters, world)
- 🛠️ Easy build system (CMake + GitHub Actions CI)
- 🎮 MMO-ready networking with scalability in mind

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

DestinyCore depends on modern development tools and libraries:

- **CMake 3.31+**
- **Boost 1.84.0**
- **MySQL 8.0**
- **OpenSSL 3.x**
- **GCC / Clang / MSVC (Visual Studio 2022 recommended)**
